  <h2><a name="intro">1. What is Proai?</a></h2>
  <p>
    Proai is a repository-neutral, Java web application supporting the 
    <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">Open 
    Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH) version
    2.0.  By implementing a repository-specific driver, developers can provide 
    a full-featured OAI-PMH access point to their existing software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proai offers the following features:
    <ul>
      <li> Record caching.  Proai maintains it's own up-to-date copy of all 
           records from the source repository.
           This design has the following benefits:
        <ul>
           <li> Performance. Delivery to harvesters is very fast and does not
                put a load on the source repository.</li>
           <li> Reliability. Temporary unavailability of the source repository
                does not disrupt the OAI-PMH interface or put it out-of-synch.
                </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Automatic record validation with schema caching.</li>
      <li> Configurable OAI response sizes.</li>
      <li> Support for date-selective harvesting with seconds granularity.</li>
      <li> Support for flat or hierarchical sets.</li>
      <li> Support for persistent deleted records.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="diff">2. How does it work?</a></h2>
  <p>
    Before attempting to use Proai for your own OAI-PMH needs, you
    should have a basic understanding of how it works.
  </p>
  <div class="subsect">
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Proai is installed as a service that sits between a source
      repository and OAI harvesters.  On the front end, it responds
      to OAI requests by consulting its local XML Record Cache.
      On the back end, it keeps this cache up-to-date by periodically
      communicating with the source repository through a repository-specific
      interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="overview.png"/>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsect">
    <h4>Front End</h4>
    <p>
      When a harvester sends an OAI request, Proai interprets the
      request and consults the <i>record cache</i>, which consists
      of database tables and XML record files on disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a response exceeds a configured number of records, Proai
      takes care of splitting it into multiple parts and generating a
      <code>resumptionToken</code> for each part.  In OAI-PMH,
      this is known as
      <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#FlowControl">Flow Control</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front end depends solely on the record cache.  It does not
      directly access the source repository and therefore can do its job
      even when the source repository is unavailable.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsect">
    <h4>Back End</h4>
    <p>
      The job of Proai's back-end is to keep the record cache up to date.
      This is done through a process known as the <i>update cycle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During an update cycle, the <i>cache updater</i> communicates
      with the source repository via the <a href="api/proai/driver/OAIDriver.html">OAIDriver interface</a>.
      An update cycle progresses as follows:
      <ol>
        <li> First, the updater queries for the current list of all sets to
      see if any have changed since the previous cycle.  If so, the database
      is updated accordingly.</li>
        <li> Next, it queries for the list of new/modified records and enqueues 
      them for processing.  
        <li> Finally, the updater processes the queue, 
      committing each change to the record cache.  For each record, this
      involves getting the XML from the remote location, validating it, 
      and removing it from the queue.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> See the <a href="configuration.html">Configuration Reference</a>
           and edit your <code>proai.properties</code> file accordingly.
      </li>
      <li> To configure logging, edit the included <code>log4j.xml</code>
           file and make sure it's in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>.

  <h2><a name="impl">5. Implementation Guide</a></h2>
<p>
  Using Proai for your own repository software is a matter of creating
  an 
  <code>OAIDriver</code>
    implementation.  See the included source code of <code>
    <a href="api/proai/driver/impl/OAIDriverImpl.html">OAIDriverImpl</a>
  </code>
  for an example.

    <ul>
      <li> Response compression (e.g. gzip) is not currently supported. </li>
